# Named Anchors

Anchors give you the ability to link to elements within your site. Every module has an anchor.

When you look at a website's address, for example www.pinkpigeon.co.uk, if you needed to link to a specific module, it could look like this www.pinkpigeon.co.uk/#about

Everything that follows the '#' character is an anchor.

Since all modules have an anchor, the CMS automatically generates these, and that doesn't necessarily look pretty in the browser's address bar, for example: https://pinkpigeon.co.uk/pricing/#text_only_4F9B5FF0AA21F521CDAE_anchor

Named anchors allow you to make 'prettier' links to elements on your site. So, instead of the 'ugly' anchor, we can give it our own name: https://pinkpigeon.co.uk/pricing/#our_prices
