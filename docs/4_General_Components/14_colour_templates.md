# Colour Templates

Colour templates allow you to define a colour template in the ['Essentials'](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/5_Pages/2_essentials.html#colour-templates) module.

A colour template records a specific setting for various standard module colours, such as font, background and CTA (button) colours.

This can reduce a lot of the effort in creating websites with alternating colour styles, as you now only need to select the colour template, instead of setting all colours individually.
