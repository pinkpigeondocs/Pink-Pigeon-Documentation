# Adding / Moving / Removing

This component deals with all pages and modules that offer the functionality to add, move or remove an item. For example, you can find it at the top the 'Menu and Navigation' section, and it looks like this, if you are an advanced user:

This component is different for standard and advanced users. Standard users will often be limited to just moving items, like this:

## Adding

Selecting the 'Add' button will immediately create a new list item, which will not have any information pre-filled. Most of the time, this item will not be shown by the CMS until its most essential information has been filled in.

## Moving

Selecting the 'Move' button will create moving handles on the right of any list item, like so:

This simultaneously disables all editing functionality for the item, as well as the other functions of the component, such as 'add' or 'delete'.

Moving items is done by selecting (and holding) the draggable handle and moving the list item to the new desired position.

You may accept your changes by selecting the 'back' button:

Your changes have not been saved yet. This only happens once you select one of the ['save'][save] buttons.

The 'Delete' button will create checkboxes to the right of any list item, like so:
