# Module Edit - Bottom Bar

![Image of the bottom bar in module edit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/module_edit_bottom_bar.png)

The bottom bar is always visible and provides the options for going back to the previous page, saving your module & exiting the module edit screen at the same time, or saving the module while staying on the module edit screen (this is particularly useful while editing with a preview page open).

## Going back

When selecting the '< Back' button, you will leave the 'Module Edit' screen, no matter whether your changes have been saved. A prompt will ask you whether you would like to leave. This can be circumvented by hitting CTRL + Backspace.

## Saving changes

You may save your changes by selecting one of the 'save' buttons.
