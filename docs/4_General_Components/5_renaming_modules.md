# Renaming Modules

![Image of a module title, with editing pen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/4_General_Components/images/edit_module.png)

Clicking either the edit-pen, or the name of a module will enable name editing. You may then enter a new name for the module. Once you hit 'save', the new name will have been applied.

```warning
Don't forget to save your module, otherwise the change will not apply.
```
