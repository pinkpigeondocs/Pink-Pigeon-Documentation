# Image Library

The image library lets you manage all imagery uploaded to your website.
Hovering over an image will show the whole image, which can be useful if your image's proportions are extremely wide or tall.

## Adding Images

You can add one or more images via the '+' icon in the middle, at the top of the image library.

### Fix Image Links

Please note that any images currently in use on your site will be deleted and therefore not be displayed on your website anymore. You will need to find and setup a new imagery in their place.
