# Grids

![Image of three image-only grid modules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/4_General_Components/images/general_components_grid_desktop.png)

Some modules support the grid-functionality. You have to add 3 grid-type modules next to each other, for the CMS to arrange them as a grid. (You may also use any multiples of 3. The CMS will recognise these modules in configurations of 6, 9, 12, etc.)

Therefore, it is entirely feasible to make a website completely from grid modules.

These modules exist as grid-variations:

- Image Only
- Text Only
- Video Only
- Map
