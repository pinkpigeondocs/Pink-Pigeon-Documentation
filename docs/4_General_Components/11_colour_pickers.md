![Image of the header overlay desktop font colour option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/8_header_desktop_font_colour.png)

Colour pickers exist throughout the website builder, you will encounter them in almost all modules.

Any colour you have defined in the [essentials module](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/5_Pages/2_essentials.html#colour-palette) shows up in this selection. Thus, if you change any of the colours in essentials, they change for your entire website.

If you are interested in reading about colour palettes, [this site](https://coolors.co/) is a great resource.
