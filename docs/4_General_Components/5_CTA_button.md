# CTAs / Buttons

Many modules come with the option to have a "Call to Action", which generally refers to a button, linking somewhere else, or triggering some kind of event. The reason this is referred to as a Call to Action, is that usually these kinds of buttons should motivate visitors of your website to do something, such as, to use a classical example, "Buy Now!", though it's better to be more subtle than that.

## Enabling / Disabling CTAs

This is how you turn a CTA on / off.

## CTA Options

Once enabled, many options are revealed:

- **Text:** This is the text or label for your CTA

## CTA Links

The Link section has multiple options:

- **Site Anchor:** You may select any section of your website using this option ![Image of the CTA option, site anchor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/4_General_Components/images/general_components_cta_links_anchor.png)

- **External URL:** This can be any link on the web. You do not need to enter the "https://" or "http://" part of a url here. For example, "www.pinkpigeon.co.uk", or "pinkpigeon.co.uk" would suffice. ![Image of the CTA option, external url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/4_General_Components/images/general_components_cta_links_external.png)

- **File:** This is a file upload, where you may upload any type of file up to 2MB big. For bigger files, you would have to [contact us](https://cms.pinkpigeon.co.uk/contact). If you have already uploaded your file, you may select it here: ![Image of the CTA option, files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/4_General_Components/images/general_components_cta_links_file.png), otherwise, you may upload a new file using the upload button: ![Image of the up-arrow for file uploads](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/up_arrow_icon.png)

## CTA Colours

The colours of your button behave differently, based on whether you have selected [transparent or opaque](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/5_Pages/1_essentials.html#advanced-users-buttons) buttons.

- **Transparent buttons:** The CTA will inherit the font colour selected for your module (usually higher up on the same module edit page), and their rollover colour (for the button border and text) can be customised, like so:

- **Opaque buttons:** For opaque CTAs, you will be able to customise every single colour available, per CTA, like so:
