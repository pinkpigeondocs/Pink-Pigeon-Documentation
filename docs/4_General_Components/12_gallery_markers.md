## Navigation Dots

- **Enabled / Disabled:** You can turn off the markers entirely, if desired.

- **Background Style:** There are three options for the marker backgrounds. None: ![Image of the gallery module's marker option 'transparent background'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_markers_transparent_background.png) / opaque (with a customisable background colour): ![Image of the gallery module's marker option 'transparent background'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_markers_opaque_background.png) and 'gradient', which you can see above.

- **Dot Colour:** This allows you to change the colour of the dots in their initial state (in above images, that is white).

- **Selected Dot Colour:** This allows you to change the colour of whichever dot corresponds to the image that is currently showing.

- **Dot Rollover Colour:** This is the colour of any dot that the user's mouse is hovering over.

## Navigation Arrows

Below is an example of what the navigation arrows may look like for the testimonials module. The mechanics are the same for all gallery-based modules.
