# Above The Footer

We will be using our very own site [pinkpigeon.co.uk](https://pinkpigeon.co.uk) for all of our examples. Here is the home screen (which will be the first screen you see after logging in):

## The Pink Pigeon Logo

In the top left corner you can see our Pink Pigeon logo, which will always take you back to this screen, from anywhere within the CMS.

## Your website's name

Immediately below, your website's name (Please note that you cannot change this yourself. If you would like it changed, please [contact us](https://cms.pinkpigeon.co.uk/contact)):

## Essentials and Navigation

The next two items are ["Website Essentials"](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#website-essentials) and ["Menu and Navigation"](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#menu-and-navigation). These exist for evey website and have their own sections within the documentation.

## Your website's pages

Then we have the pages of your website. If you look at their titles, you will see how they correspond with the navigation items on our website.
Please note that "Home" is a mandatory page, as every website needs to have a "Home" page, thus it is not normally shown as a navigation item on your website.

As you can see, neither their order, nor whether the item is shown at all, matches with what the CMS shows. That is because these items are fully configurable. For a how-to, feel free to go to [the navigation section](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#menu-and-navigation).

## The preview button

The "Preview" button will take you to the preview of your website. There is a dedicated section about previews. This button will remain visible where-ever you scroll within the page.
