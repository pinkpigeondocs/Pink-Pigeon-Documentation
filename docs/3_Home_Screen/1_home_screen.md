# Above The Footer

Here is the home screen (which will be the first screen you see after logging in):

There is also a video introducing this part of the CMS:

<iframe class="vimeo_player" width="1280" height="720" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/539243236?autoplay=1&loop=1&quality=1080p" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Notifications

Notifications are displayed at the top of the page. You can close them by selecting the "X". All notifications except the one for pending websites will disappear forever once closed, so make sure to read these carefully.

## The Pink Pigeon Logo

In the top left corner you can see our Pink Pigeon logo, which will always take you back to this screen, from anywhere within the CMS.

## Website Name / Settings

Immediately below, you can see your website's name:

![Image of the home screen, website title highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/3_Home_Screen/images/home_main_site_settings.png)

This is where you can rename your site by clicking on its title, or access your website's settings, by clicking on the settings cog next to your site's title.

This will allow you to change your website's name, where contact forms are sent, [add an analytics code](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/8_Technical/3_analytics.html), if you are a [Silver][accounttypes] or [Gold][accounttypes] user, and you will be able to see statistics on your website's size, or the number of modules and pages you are using:

If you are a [Bronze][accounttypes] or [Silver][accounttypes] user, you can upgrade your account from here as well, if you need either added analytics features, higher account limits or faster support.

## Essentials and Navigation

The next two items are ["Website Essentials"](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#website-essentials) and ["Menu and Navigation"](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#menu-and-navigation). These exist for evey website and have their own sections within the documentation.

## Your website's content

Then we have the pages of your website. If you look at their titles, you will see how they correspond with the navigation items on our website.
Please note that "Home" is a mandatory page, as every website needs to have a "Home" page, thus it is not normally shown as a navigation item on your website.

![Image of the home screen, page names highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/3_Home_Screen/images/home_page_names_highlighted.png)

![Image of the pink pigeon website, page names highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/3_Home_Screen/images/pp_website_nav_example.png)

As you can see, neither their order, nor whether the item is shown at all, matches with what the CMS shows. That is because these items are fully configurable. For a how-to, feel free to go to [the navigation section](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#menu-and-navigation).

## The preview button

The "Preview" button will take you to the preview of your website. There is a dedicated section about previews. This button will remain visible where-ever you scroll within the page.

## The publish button

The "Publish" button will publish your website. It is only visible when you have made changes to your website that can be published.

## Pink outlines

When a page or module has been outlined in pink, this means that changes have been made to a page's module, which have not been published yet. Below you can see an example of what this looks like for a page and a module.
