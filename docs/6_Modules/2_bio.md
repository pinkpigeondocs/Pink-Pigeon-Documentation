# Bio

The Bio module originated from the need to list attributes of actors, but is also suitable as a general CV module. Please see an example below:

## Body Text

![Image of the body text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/body_text.png)

This is a [rich](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html) body text input **without** a character limit.

Here it is in the module:

```tip
It is still a good idea to limit the amount of text somewhat, as the design of the site may stretch too far in trying to accommodate a large amount of text
```

## Bio Fields

These are the double columns within the Bio module. Here is the CMS view:

As you can see, these correspond to the text columns online:

## Lower Body Text

This is a second, lower [rich](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html) body text input **without** a character limit. It provides the ability to add an outro-text below the two text columns.

Here it is in the module:

## On Mobile

On tablet / mobile resolutions, the Awards module loads a second image (this can be the same image, too), to allow for a different arrangement of awards, should their shapes differ greatly. See an example below:
