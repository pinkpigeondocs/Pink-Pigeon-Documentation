# Bio

The Bio module originated from the need to list attributes of actors, but is also suitable as a general CV module. Please see an example below:

## Body Text

This is a [rich](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html) body text input **without** a character limit.

Here it is in the module:

```tip
It is still a good idea to limit the amount of text somewhat, as the design of the site may stretch too far in trying to accommodate a large amount of text
```

## Bio Fields

These are the double columns within the Bio module. Here is the CMS view:

As you can see, these correspond to the text columns online:

## Colours

The Awards module allows you to change the background colour and text colour of the module.

## On Mobile

On tablet / mobile resolutions, the Awards module loads a second image (this can be the same image, too), to allow for a different arrangement of awards, should their shapes differ greatly. See an example below:
