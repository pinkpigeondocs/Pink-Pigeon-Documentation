This is the header-image module section.

## Desktop Image

The header module's desktop image. Read up on changing images [here](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/2_image_picker.html).

## Vertical Alignment

Because many images may not fit perfectly into the space reserved for them, you can control the vertical alignment, 'sliding' the image up or down within its space. Here is an example. Here is an example at 0%:

![Image of the image panel of a text and image module at 0% alignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/12_text_and_image_0_percent.png)

Here is an example at 100%:

You may notice the locks in the image have moved up.

## Mobile Image

The header module's mobile image. Read up on changing images [here](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/2_image_picker.html).

## Vertical Alignment
