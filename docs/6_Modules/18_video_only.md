# Video Only

This module displays a video and nothing else. There is a [grid](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/7_grids.html) variant of this module.

You may choose between YouTube and Vimeo.

## Video ID

- **Youtube:** For Youtube, you need to copy this part of the URL (they can look different at times, but there is always an ID somewhere in the URL): ![Image of the youtube url example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/16_text_and_video_youtube_url.png).

- **Vimeo:** For Vimeo, you need to copy this part of the URL: ![Image of the vimeo url example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/16_text_and_video_vimeo_url.png).

## (Vimeo) Autoplay
![Image of the vimeo autoplay option example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/18_video_only_vimeo_autoplay.png)

Vimeo videos can play automatically, if there is no sound on the video.

## (Vimeo) Video Quality

For desktop video only, you can define a starting video quality. Please bear in mind that very high quality video can use up a lot of bandwidth, so for some users this may incur unforeseen costs.
For mobile videos, Vimeo will always judge the default video quality by itself.

## Background Colour

The Video Only module allows you to change the background colour of the module (as videos do not necessarily fit the module perfectly).
