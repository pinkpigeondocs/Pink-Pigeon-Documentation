# Find Us

The 'Find Us' module allows you to put in opening times and / or an address for your business (or any other information that fits the format).
Please note that this is not the [map](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/6_Modules/11_map.html) module, which is what you would use to put a map onto your website.


## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

## Body Text

This is a [rich](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html) body text input **without** a character limit.

Here it is in the module:

```tip
It is still a good idea to limit the amount of text somewhat, as the design of the site may stretch too far in trying to accommodate a large amount of text
```

## Optional Columns

In the middle of the Find Us module, there are 0-3 optional columns (they show up automatically based on whether they have been filled in).

The columns are designed to allow for entering up to 7 items, some of which can be one-liners (column 1 and 3) or composed of 2 parts (column 2). The two-part column is useful for adding opening times for example.

Deleting lines from the optional columns is done via the checkboxes next to the line items and followed by clicking the 'bin' button, like so:
