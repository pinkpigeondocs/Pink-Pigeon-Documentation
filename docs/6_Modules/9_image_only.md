## Vertical Alignment

![Image of the vertical alignment option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/vertical_alignment.png)

Because many images may not fit perfectly into the space reserved for them, you can control the vertical alignment, 'sliding' the image up or down within its space. Here is an example. Here is an example at 0% (Or "image should sit as far down as possible within its space):

![Image of the image panel of a text and image module at 0% alignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/12_text_and_image_0_percent.png)

Here is an example at 100% (Or "image should sit as high up as possible within its space):

You may notice the locks in the image have moved up.
