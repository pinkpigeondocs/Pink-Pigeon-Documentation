![Image of the image only module online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/9_image_only_online.png)

This module displays one image, nothing else. There is a [grid](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/7_grids.html) variant of this module.

## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

## Image

Here you can select the image for your module.

## Vertical Alignment

![Image of the vertical alignment option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/vertical_alignment.png)

Because many images may not fit perfectly into the space reserved for them, you can control the vertical alignment, 'sliding' the image up or down within its space. Here is an example. Here is an example at 0% (Or "image should sit as far down as possible within its space):

![Image of the image panel of a text and image module at 0% alignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/12_text_and_image_0_percent.png)

Here is an example at 100% (Or "image should sit as high up as possible within its space):

![Image of the image panel of a text and image module at 100% alignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/12_text_and_image_100_percent.png)

You may notice the locks in the image have moved up.
