# Text and Image

The Text and Image module is one of our most used modules. That is because most content online is just that: Pictures with accompanying text. Please see an example below:

- **Image:** This controls the [image](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/2_image_picker.html) of the text module, for example: ![Image of the image panel of a text and image module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/14_text_and_image_image_panel.png)

- **Desktop Image Side:** You can 'flip' the text and image around, for example: ![Image of the image panel of a text and image module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/14_text_and_image_image_on_right.png)

- **(Standard Users) Body Text:** This is the body text within a text and image module:

Please note that this is a rich text field. More info on that [here](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html).
On desktop resolutons, this field has a height limitation, to ensure clean layouts, which is why the character limit is 450.

```tip
You can leave any text field blank, and the CMS will adjust the layout to make the remaining text elements fit. You could even leave all text out, if desired.
```

- **(Advanced Users) Background / Font Colour:** You can control the background colour and text colour of text and image modules using these controls.

```tip
If a small or large module-gap was selected, the text and image module takes this into account, see [Module Spacing in Essentials](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/5_Pages/1_essentials.html#advanced-users-module-spacing) for more information.

## Button

Please refer to the [CTA / Button section](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/5_CTA_button.html) for more info about the button.

## On Mobile

The Text and Image module adapts to smaller resolution screens by flipping from a horizontal to a vertical arrangement, with the image always sitting on top (that means the 'Desktop Image Side' has no effect at tablet resolution and below).
The text-panel of this module is not height-limited on mobile.
