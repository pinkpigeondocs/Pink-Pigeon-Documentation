# Awards

The Awards module is very similar to the image-only module, but it allows switching between mobile and desktop images, to allow for specific designs / arrangements of many awards (as they are often awkward / very different shapes). Please see an example below:

## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

## On Mobile

On tablet / mobile resolutions, the Awards module loads a second image (this can be the same image, too), to allow for a different arrangement of awards, should their shapes differ greatly. See an example below:
