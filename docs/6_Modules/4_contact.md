# Contact

The Contact module turns into a contact form on your website:

![Image of the contact module online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_online.png)

When a visitor to your website fills in the form, you will receive an e-mail including all the info that was filled in on the form.

## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

## Form Name

![Image of the contact module's form name input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_form_name.png)

You can name your forms (at pinkpigeon.co.uk, for example, we have 6 contact forms, one for each section). The CMS will include this name when e-mailing you, so you know what section of your website a visitor contacted you from.

When we e-mail you, the form name will be included in the message (please note that the originating URL is also included in the e-mail, so you know it came from us):

## Body Text

![Image of the body text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/body_text.png)

This is a [rich](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html) body text input **without** a character limit.

Here it is in the module:

```tip
It is still a good idea to limit the amount of text somewhat, as the design of the site may stretch too far in trying to accommodate a large amount of text
```

## Form Fields

![Image of the contact module form fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_form_fields.png)

Each item consists of four items:

- The type of form field, which can be Name, Email, Phone Number, Date, Message, Optional (Text), Time.
- Whether the field will be required (marked by an asterisk), or not.
- Whether the field will be half-width or full-width. The form in this tutorial has two half-width fields (Name / Email) and two full-width fields (Phone / Message). This allows for composing fields according to the amount of text they are expected to hold, or simply aesthetics.
- The label of the field, e.g. what it will be called in the form, visible to the user.

## Contact Method

![Image of the contact module's contact method](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_method.png)

You may choose whether to give your visitors the option of indicating how they'd like to be contacted.

Here it is online:

![Image of the contact module's contact method online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_preferred_method_online.png)

```tip
If you have enabled the preferred contact method option, double check that you have form-fields corresponding to 'e-mail' and 'phone number'.
```

## Legal Confirmations


## Colours

The Awards module allows you to change the background colour and text colour of the module.

## Input Options:

- **Stroke Colour:**

## Button

This is a special button / CTA section, as this button only submits the form. Therefore, the copy cannot be customised (and file downloads, or external URLs are disabled). You can still customise all colours, as described in the [CTA / Button section](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/5_CTA_button.html)
