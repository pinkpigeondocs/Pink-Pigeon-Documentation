# Contact

The Contact module turns into a contact form on your website:

![Image of the contact module online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_online.png)

When a visitor to your website fills in the form, you will receive an e-mail including all the info that was filled in on the form.

## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

[endis]: https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/4_enabling_disabling_modules.html

## Form Name

![Image of the contact module's form name input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_form_name.png)

You can name your forms (at pinkpigeon.co.uk, for example, we have 6 contact forms, one for each section). The CMS will include this name when e-mailing you, so you know what section of your website a visitor contacted you from.

When we e-mail you, the form name will be included in the message (please note that the originating URL is also included in the e-mail, so you know it came from us):

## Header Text

This is the header text in the contact module.

Here it is online:

## Body Text

![Image of the body text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/body_text.png)

This is a [rich](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html) body text input **without** a character limit.

Here it is in the module:

![Image of the contact module body text online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_body_text_online.png)


```tip
It is still a good idea to limit the amount of text somewhat, as the design of the site may stretch too far in trying to accommodate a large amount of text
```

## Form Fields

![Image of the contact module form fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_form_fields.png)

Each item consists of four items:

- The type of form field, which can be Name, Email, Phone Number, Date, Message, Optional (Text), Time.
- Whether the field will be required (marked by an asterisk), or not. ![Image of the contact module asterisks online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_asterisks_online.png)


- Whether the field will be half-width or full-width. The form in this tutorial has two half-width fields (Name / Email) and two full-width fields (Phone / Message). This allows for composing fields according to the amount of text they are expected to hold, or simply aesthetics.
- The label of the field, e.g. what it will be called in the form, visible to the user.

## Contact Method

![Image of the contact module's contact method](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_method.png)

You may choose whether to give your visitors the option of indicating how they'd like to be contacted.

Here it is online:

![Image of the contact module's contact method online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_preferred_method_online.png)

```tip
If you have enabled the preferred contact method option, double check that you have form-fields corresponding to 'e-mail' and 'phone number'.
```

## Legal Confirmations

![Image of the contact module's legal confirmations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_legal_confirmations.png)

The legal confirmations are part required (for GDPR reasons) and part optional. Legally, you cannot gather the information people submit as part of contact forms without first making your visitors confirm that they are happy for you to do so.

![Image of the contact module's legal confirmations online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_legal_confirmations_online.png)

The 'submit' button of the form will only become enabled once all required legal confirmations have been checked. (The opacity of the submit button changes, to indicate this to your visitors.)

## Colours

The Contact module allows you to change the background colour and text colour of the module.

![Image of the standard colours](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/standard_colours.png)

## Input Options:

![Image of the contact module's form input options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_form_input_options.png)

- **Stroke Colour:** This is the colour of the border around the input field.

- **Fill Colour:** You can determine the fill colour of contact fields (please make sure to use a font that has a high contrast with the form field).

- **Active Stroke Colour:** When your visitors select a form field, this colour will be used as a highlight, replacing the border colour.

## Button

This is a special button / CTA section, as this button only submits the form. Therefore, fhe function of it cannot be customised (and file downloads, or external URLs are disabled). You can still customise the text of the button and all colours, as described in the [CTA / Button section](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/5_CTA_button.html)

## Confirmation Header Text

![Image of the contact module's header text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/header_text.png)

The confirmation header text is shown on the 'Thank You'-screen, which follows a successful form submission.

![Image of the contact module's thank you screen header text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_form_thankyou_header.png)

## Confirmation Body Text

![Image of the contact module's thank you body text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_body.png)

This is a [rich](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html) body text input **without** a character limit.

The confirmation body text is also part of the 'Thank You'-screen.
