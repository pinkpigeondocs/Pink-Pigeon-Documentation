# Contact

The Contact module turns into a contact form on your website:

When a visitor to your website fills in the form, you will receive an e-mail including all the info that was filled in on the form.

## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

## Form Name

You can name your forms (at Pinkpigeon, for example, we have 6 contact forms, one for each section). The CMS will include this name when e-mailing you, so you know what section of your website a visitor contacted you from.

## Header Text
