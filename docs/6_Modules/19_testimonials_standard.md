# Testimonials Standard

The standard testimonials module includes a text panel and image panel. The text panel consists of a heading, body text and smaller, bold customer name. There is a [text-only variant](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/7_grids.html) of this module.

## Testimonials Panel

A testimonial item consists of the following items:

- **Alt Text**

The image alt text is a placeholder, which is shown if the image can't be displayed. It is also essential for screen readers, which would read this out to vision impaired users.

## Image Fit

![Image of the testimonial module's image fit option in the website builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/19_testimonials_standard_image_fit_cms.png)

- **Cover:** This option will ensure that the image is always filling the space it sits within, at the cost of some of the edges being cut off for certain screen resolutions. This is the option used throughout this page.

- **Scale-down:** This option will always make the whole image visible (which is useful for portrait or very wide images), but it means that there will be a visible background colour in areas of the module that the image does not cover, as shown:

## Auto Scroll:

![Image of the testimonial module's auto scroll option in the website builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/19_testimonials_standard_auto_scroll_cms.png)

The testimonials module scrolls through testimonials at a 4 second interval by default. This can be turned off.

## Scroll Interval:

![Image of the testimonial module's scroll interval option in the website builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/19_testimonials_standard_scroll_interval_cms.png)

This is the scroll interval in milliseconds.

## Quotation Marks

![Image of the testimonial module's quotation marks option in the website builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/19_testimonials_standard_quotation_marks_cms.png)

## Marker Options

![Image of the module's marker options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_marker_options.png)

- **Background Style:** There are three options for the marker backgrounds. None: ![Image of the module's marker option 'transparent background'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_markers_transparent_background.png) / opaque (with a customisable background colour): ![Image of the module's marker option 'transparent background'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_markers_opaque_background.png) and 'gradient', which you can see above.

- **Dot Colour:** This allows you to change the colour of the dots in their initial state (in above images, that is white).

- **Selected Dot Colour:** This allows you to change the colour of whichever dot corresponds to the image that is currently showing.

- **Dot Rollover Colour:** This is the colour of any dot that the user's mouse is hovering over.

## Navigation Arrows

![Image of the module's arrow options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/19_testimonials_standard_navigation_arrows_cms.png)

![Image of the module's arrow options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/19_testimonials_standard_navigation_arrows_online.png)

## On Mobile

The testimonials module changes shape on mobile, to stack vertically, with the markers being placed in the middle.
