# Spreadsheet

The spreadsheet module lets you display a Google Spreadsheet on your website.
This spreadsheet will update live as you make updates (with a maximum of a few minutes delay), which can be useful for managing bookings or event calendars.

## Spreadsheet Link

This is the link from your Google Spreasheet. This has to be the 'embed' version of your spreadsheet.

## Spreadsheet Height

Lets you define the module's height. Since spreadsheets can be all sorts of different heights, this can help prevent scroll bars. If your spreadsheet goes beyond this value, it will scroll vertically.

## Spreadsheet Width

Lets you define the spreadsheet container's width within the module. This is also to prevent scroll bars. However, since most spreadsheets are wider than the space available on most websites, it is likely that there will be horizontal scroll bars.
