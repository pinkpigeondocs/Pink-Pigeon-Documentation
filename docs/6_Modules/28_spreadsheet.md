# iFrame

The iFrame module lets you display another website like a module on your website. The iFrame module is not limited in size, meaning it will fill a whole page and is thus best suited for showing an entire website like a whole section of your website.

## iFrame Link

This is the iFrame link. Because many iFrames include options to be included in the iFrame Tag, this is has to be an html-formatted iFrame link, in the following format: `<iframe src="iframe"></iframe>` etc.

This will allow you to control the width / height of the iFrame by adding width="500" (or another number of pixels) or height="" attributes within the `<iframe>` tag.

## Background Colour

The background colour to fill the module with. This can help in case of complex iFrames not fitting the module's space properly.
