# Text and Gallery

The Text and Image module is one of our most used modules. That is because most content online is just that: Pictures with accompanying text. Please see an example below:

## Grid Version

There is a variant of this module.

## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

## Text Panel

- **Header Text:** This is the header within a text and image module:

- **Body Text:** This is the body text within a text and image module:

![Image of the text panel of a text and image module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/14_text_and_image_text_panel_body.png)

Please note that this is a rich text field. More info on that [here](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html).
On desktop resolutons, this field has a height limitation, to ensure clean layouts, which is why the character limit is 450.

```tip
You can leave any text field blank, and the website builder will adjust the layout to make the remaining text elements fit. You could even leave all text out, if desired.
```

- **Background / Font Colour:** You can control the background colour and text colour of text and image modules using these controls.

```tip
If a small or large module-gap was selected, the text and image module takes this into account, see [Module Spacing in Essentials](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/5_Pages/1_essentials.html#advanced-users-module-spacing) for more information.

## Gallery Panel - Images

![Image of the gallery module's images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_images.png)

Here you may add / re-order / remove images from your gallery. Please note that the images start out in a compact state, like this:

![Image of the gallery module's image list items, compact form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_compact.png)

These items expand when clicked:

![Image of the gallery module's image list items, expanded form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_expanded.png)

Selecting the 'collapse'-button will make the item compact again. ![Image of the collapse button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/collapse_button.png)

## Gallery Panel - Image Fit

![Image of the gallery module's image fit option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_image_fit.png)

The image fit option allows you to specify whether your gallery should try to 'fit' the whole image into the space of the gallery ('cover'), or shrink the image within the space. This is easiest to see visually:

**Cover**

![Image of the gallery module online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_online.png)

**Scaledown**

![Image of the gallery module, scale-down option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_scaledown.png)

## Gallery Panel - Auto Scroll

![Image of the gallery module's auto scroll option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_autoscroll.png)

By default, a gallery automatically scrolls through its images at a set interval.

## Gallery Panel - Scroll Interval

![Image of the gallery module's scroll interval option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_interval.png)

You can define how quickly the images of the gallery change, in milliseconds. Therefore, 4000, for example, is equivalent to 4 seconds.

## Gallery Panel - Background Colour

![Image of the gallery module's background colour option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_background_colour.png)

You may customise the background colour shown when using 'scale down' as an image fit option.

## Gallery Panel - Marker Options

![Image of the gallery module's marker options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_marker_options.png)

- **Enabled / Disabled:** You can turn off the markers entirely, if desired.

- **Background Style:** There are three options for the marker backgrounds. None: ![Image of the gallery module's marker option 'transparent background'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_markers_transparent_background.png) / opaque (with a customisable background colour): ![Image of the gallery module's marker option 'transparent background'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_markers_opaque_background.png) and 'gradient', which you can see above.

- **Dot Colour:** This allows you to change the colour of the dots in their initial state (in above images, that is white).

- **Selected Dot Colour:** This allows you to change the colour of whichever dot corresponds to the image that is currently showing.

- **Dot Rollover Colour:** This is the colour of any dot that the user's mouse is hovering over.

## Gallery Panel - Arrow Options

![Image of the gallery module's navigation arrow options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/6_gallery_arrows.png)

- **Show Arrows:**

You can enable or disable the arrows. Here is an example without arrows:
