This is a [rich](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html) body text input **without** a character limit.

Here it is in the module:

This is a [rich](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html) body text input **without** a character limit.

```tip
It is still a good idea to limit the amount of text somewhat, as the design of the site may stretch too far in trying to accommodate a large amount of text
```

## Colours

The Prices - Buttons module allows you to change the background colour and text colour of the module.

## Price List Buttons

![Image of the Prices - Buttons module list items in website builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/13_prices_buttons_cms.png)

You may add up to 8 buttons to your price list. Items without either a description or file will not show.

The buttons are fully responsive and arrange themselves dynamically based on the device (or screen width) they are viewed on.

Here are some examples of how 7 buttons arrange themselves (you might notice that above, there are 8 items, however no file has been uploaded for one of them, meaning it will not show):

**Narrow**

**Medium**

**Wide**

All other numbers of buttons follow similar conventions as above.

## Button Styling

The button styling follows the same conventions as other CTA / Buttons (such as whether transparent or opaque buttons have been selected.)

Please refer to the [CTA / Button section](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/5_CTA_button.html) for more info about button styling.
