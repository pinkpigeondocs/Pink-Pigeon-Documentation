This is an unlimited-height module, which can be used as a full-page image gallery, connecting via your Instagram feed.
The Instagram module is responsive; The number of columns is adjusted as the screen-width shrinks.

## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

## Background Colour

The Instagram module respects the [grid-gap value](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/5_Pages/1_essentials.html#advanced-users-module-spacing). Therefore, you can define a background colour to show behind your Instagram images.

## Max Images to Show

You may limit the number of images to display from your feed. (Images are in most-recent to least-recent order.)

## Max Columns

You can decide the number of columns the Instagram module shows at the largest screen-width (1200px and above). In this case, 6 columns.

## Connect Instagram

If you have not connected your Instagram feed, this is where you can do it. Here are the steps:

- Click 'Open Connection Window', which opens a separate window with a link, which looks like this: ![Image of the connection window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/10_instagram_connection_window.png)

- When you follow this link, Instagram will ask you to log in (you may have to agree to cookies first): ![Image of the connection window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/10_instagram_login_window.png)

- If everything went well, your Instagram module's edit page will show you the token that has been exchanged with Instagram: ![Image of the instagram token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/10_instagram_token.png)
