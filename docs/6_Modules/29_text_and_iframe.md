# Text and iFrame

This is a specialised module, which is not yet accessible to normal users. The documentation will be updated when it becomes accessible to all users.
The purpose of this module is to allow for displaying iFrames in a customised panel. This is especially useful for booking widgets, etc.

## iFrame Panel

This is the panel containing the options for the iFrame portion of the module.

### Panel Width

The iFrame panel will always be a fixed width, which you can define here, in pixels.

### iFrame Link

This is the iFrame link, which needs to be formatted with `<iframe>` tags, as many iFrames support inserting additional attributes, like width, height and others.

## Text Panel

This is the text panel, which functions exactly as the [text panel of text and image](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/6_Modules/14_text_and_image.html#text-panel) modules would.
