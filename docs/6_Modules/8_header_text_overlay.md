# Header (Text Overlay)

![Image of the header-text module online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/8_header_text_online.png)

The header is a slightly more complex module. It allows for the displaying of two images, one for mobile, one for desktop resolutions (as this may work better than trying to make just one image fit such different screen sizes), though this is not mandatory.

Additionally, text can be displayed on top of the background images, such as a company tag-line. The overlay-text's position can be customised deeply.

Lastly, the mobile version of the header allows for three different image heights, depending on the best content fit.

## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

## Desktop Image

The header module's desktop image. Read up on changing images [here](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/2_image_picker.html).

## Vertical Alignment

Because many images may not fit perfectly into the space reserved for them, you can control the vertical alignment, 'sliding' the image up or down within its space. Here is an example. Here is an example at 0% (Or "image should sit as far down as possible within its space):

Here is an example at 100% (Or "image should sit as high up as possible within its space):

You may notice the locks in the image have moved up.

## Mobile Image

The header module's mobile image. Read up on changing images [here](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/2_image_picker.html).

## Vertical Alignment

See the section above, describing this.

## Overlay Element

The overlay element sits on top of the image.
