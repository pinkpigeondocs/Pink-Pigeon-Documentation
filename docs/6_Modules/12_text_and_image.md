# Text and Image

The Text and Image module is one of our most used modules. That is because most content online is just that: Pictures with accompanying text. Please see an example below:

## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

## Image Panel

- **Image:** This controls the [image](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/2_image_picker.html) of the text module, for example: ![Image of the image panel of a text and image module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/12_text_and_image_image_panel.png)

- **Desktop Image Side:** You can 'flip' the text and image video around, for example: ![Image of the image panel of a text and image module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/12_text_and_image_image_on_right.png)

- **Vertical Alignment (%):** Because many images may not fit perfectly into the space reserved for them, you can control the vertical alignment, 'sliding' the image up or down within its space. Here is an example at 0%:

![Image of the image panel of a text and image module at 0% alignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/12_text_and_image_0_percent.png)

Here is an example at 100%:

You may notice the locks in the image have moved up.

- **Body Text:** This is the body text within a text and image module:

Please note that this is a rich text field. More info on that [here](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html).
On desktop resolutons, this field has a height limitation, to ensure clean layouts, which is why the character limit is 450.

```tip
You can leave any text field blank, and the CMS will adjust the layout to make the remaining text elements fit. You could even leave all text out, if desired.
```

- **Background / Font Colour:** You can control the background colour and text colour of text and image modules using these controls.

## Button

Please refer to the [CTA / Button section](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/5_CTA_button.html) for more info about the button.

## On Mobile

The Text and Image module adapts to smaller resolution screens by flipping from a horizontal to a vertical arrangement, with the image always sitting on top (that means the 'Desktop Image Side' has no effect at tablet resolution and below).
The text-panel of this module is not height-limited on mobile.
