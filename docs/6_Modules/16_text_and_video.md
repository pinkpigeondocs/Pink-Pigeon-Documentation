- **Video Type:** You may choose between YouTube and Vimeo

- **Video ID (YouTube):** For Youtube, you need to copy this part of the URL (they can look different at times, but there is always an ID somewhere in the URL): ![Image of the text and video module - youtube url example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/16_text_and_video_youtube_url.png).

- **Video ID (Vimeo):** For Vimeo, you need to copy this part of the URL: ![Image of the text and video module - vimeo url example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/16_text_and_video_vimeo_url.png).

- **Desktop Video Side:** You can 'flip' the text and video around, for example: ![Image of the video panel of a text and video module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/16_text_and_video_video_on_right.png)

Please note that this is a rich text field. More info on that [here](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html).
On desktop resolutons, this field has a height limitation, to ensure clean layouts, which is why the character limit is 450.


```tip
You can leave any text field blank, and the CMS will adjust the layout to make the remaining text elements fit. You could even leave all text out, if desired.
```

- **Background / Font Colour:** You can control the background colour and text colour of text and image modules using these controls.

## Button
