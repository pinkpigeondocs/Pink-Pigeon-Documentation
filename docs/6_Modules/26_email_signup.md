# Email Signup

The email signup module allows you to connect your mailchimp account with your website, so that visitors can signup to your newsletter.

## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

[endis]: https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/4_enabling_disabling_modules.html

## (Re-)Connect

In order to connect your mailchimp account with the CMS, you will need to follow the login steps which are shown once you click 'Open Connection Window'.

## Form Name

This lets you define a name for your newsletter signup form. When the website builder sends you an email to tell you that someone signed up, this is the form name that will be included in the email. If, for example, you had a newsletter signup in multiple places, you could then differentiate between the different email signup modules by giving them individual names.

## Header Text

```tip
It is still a good idea to limit the amount of text somewhat, as the design of the site may stretch too far in trying to accommodate a large amount of text
```

## Form Fields

![Image of the contact module form fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_form_fields.png)

**Each item consists of four items:**

- The type of form field, which can be Name, Email, Phone Number, Date, Message, Optional (Text), Time.
- Whether the field will be required (marked by an asterisk), or not. ![Image of the email signup module asterisks online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/.png)


- Whether the field will be half-width or full-width. The form in this tutorial has two half-width fields (Name / Email) and two full-width fields (Phone / Message). This allows for composing fields according to the amount of text they are expected to hold, or simply aesthetics.
- The label of the field, e.g. what it will be called in the form, visible to the user.

## Input Options

![Image of the email signup module's form input options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_form_input_options.png)

- **Text Colour:** You can change the font colour of the inputs.

- **Fill Colour:** You can determine the fill colour of contact fields (please make sure to use a font that has a high contrast with the form field).

- **Stroke Colour:** This is the colour of the border around the input field.

- **Active Stroke Colour:** When your visitors select a form field, this colour will be used as a highlight, replacing the border colour.
