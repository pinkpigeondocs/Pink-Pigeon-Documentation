# Email Signup

The email signup module allows you to connect your mailchimp account with your website, so that visitors can signup to your newsletter.

## Enabling / Disabling

Like all modules, this module can be enabled / disabled. Please see the [corresponding section of the documentation][endis] to find out more about this functionality.

## (Re-)Connect
![Image of the email signup module's reconnect option in website builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/26_email_signup_reconnect_in_cms.png)

In order to connect your mailchimp account with the CMS, you will need to follow the login steps which are shown once you click 'Open Connection Window'.

- **Mailchimp Login Screen:**

- **Mailchimp Authorisation Screen:**

![Image of the email signup module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/26_email_signup_reconnect_mailchimp_two.png)

Here you will need to select 'Allow', for the website builder to connect with your MailChimp account. After this, you will be taken back to the website builder.

## Form Name

![Image of the email signup module's form name option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/26_email_signup_form_name_in_cms.png)

This lets you define a name for your newsletter signup form. When the website builder sends you an email to tell you that someone signed up, this is the form name that will be included in the email. If, for example, you had a newsletter signup in multiple places, you could then differentiate between the different email signup modules by giving them individual names.

## Header Text

## Body Text

![Image of the body text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/body_text.png)

This is a [rich](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html) body text input **without** a character limit.

Here it is in the module:

![Image of the prices list module body text online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/26_email_signup_online_body_text.png)

This is a [rich](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/4_General_Components/6_rich_text_editing.html) body text input **without** a character limit.

```tip
It is still a good idea to limit the amount of text somewhat, as the design of the site may stretch too far in trying to accommodate a large amount of text
```

## Form Fields

![Image of the contact module form fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/26_email_signup_form_fields_width_in_cms.png)

Any input fields can be defined as half or full-width. With half-width fields, make sure to have two of them next to each other, otherwise the other half will be empty in the module.

## Requirement Asterisk

## Legal Confirmations

![Image of the contact module's legal confirmations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_legal_confirmations.png)

The legal confirmations are part required (for GDPR reasons) and part optional. Legally, you cannot gather the information people submit as part of contact forms without first making your visitors confirm that they are happy for you to do so.

![Image of the contact module's legal confirmations online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/6_Modules/images/4_contact_legal_confirmations_online.png)

The 'submit' button of the form will only become enabled once all required legal confirmations have been checked. (The opacity of the submit button changes, to indicate this to your visitors.)
