# Page Actions

The page actions menu allows you to make various changes to your website's pages.

Note: On mobile you will need to long-press on the page whose settings you'd like to access.


## Copy Page

This allows you to copy any page within the system. All modules, text and settings from the original page will be duplicated as a copy.

## Make Homepage

Any page except for the homepage can be turned into the homepage. This can be handy for switching on / off seasonal pages of your site.
This will make your selected page the new homepage and the homepage is copied into the original page you selected.

## (Meta-)Description

This is an SEO specific setting which allows you to create a page-specific description, which Google may or may not choose to display in the search results for your site (should they decide to show section links in your search result).
