# Website Essentials

The website essentials are a collection of settings that affect the most basic parts of your website. Depending on the type of access you have, you can change many of the fundamental visual attributes of your website here.

## (Advanced Users) Colour Palette

Here you may define up to 12 colours to be used with your website. If you change a colour, it will automatically be changed on the whole website. For example, where it says "ffffff", this is the so-called [hex-code][hex] for the colour white. (You can read more about hex codes [here][hex]. If you want to find hex colours, [this website][hexweb] is quite useful), if you were to change this to another colour, all parts of the website using this white field, will change to the new colour you have assigned. (If you have two white fields in your colour palette, only the one specifically assigned to elements in the CMS changes.)

## (Standard Users) Favicon

The so-called 'Favicon' is a small logo, which will show up in browser tabs, or on the home-screen of mobile devices (if someone was to add a shortcut to your website on their mobile phone, for example).
Supported formats are .png, .jpeg / .jpg, .gif format. Technically, .ico, .svg and .bmp are supported by some browsers, but can't be guaranteed to work universally.

## (Advanced Users) Text Options:

Within the text options you may choose the font for your website. We offer 9 different fonts at the moment (and may offer more in the future). Fonts have very different levels of legibility, making it very important to ensure your website is easy to read. Often, unless needed specifically for artistic purposes, it is best to choose a simple, plain font (for example, Lato, Raleway, Montserrat, Roboto or Open Sans). There is an additional option called "Scale Multiplier", which allows you to make the font on your website bigger or smaller.

## (Advanced Users) Buttons:

All buttons on your website can be customised. Any setting here will affect all buttons at once, not individual buttons.

- **Corner Style:** Buttons can be set to have sharp corners ![Image of a button with sharp corners](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/5_Pages/images/essentials_buttons_sharp_corners.png), semi-rounded corners ![Image of a button with slightly rounded corners](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/5_Pages/images/essentials_buttons_slightly_rounded_corners.png), or fully rounded corners ![Image of a button with fully rounded corners](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/5_Pages/images/essentials_buttons_more_rounded_corners.png).
- **Fill Transparency:** When set to transparent, the background colour of the module the button is on, will 'shine through' the button. The button's text (or label) and border remain visible (and the colours, including the rollover remain customisable). All buttons in the bullet point above are transparent. An opaque button looks like this: ![Image of an opaque button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/5_Pages/images/essentials_buttons_opaque_button.png)
- **Chevron:** All buttons can have a so-called chevron, which is a visual element to indicate that the button is a link leading somewhere else. ![Image of a button with chevron](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/5_Pages/images/essentials_buttons_chevron.png)
- **Font Case:** You can pick between all buttons being labelled with lowercase letters (as shown above) or uppercase letters, like this: ![Image of an all caps button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/5_Pages/images/essentials_buttons_allcaps.png)

## (Standard Users) Footer

The footer section looks as follows:

![Image of the footer section within Essentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/5_Pages/images/essentials_footer.png)

The footer section allows you to edit:

- **Meta Description:** This is a (short) bit of copy, which is used by Google and other search engines to show what your page is about in the search results. For our own website, it looks like this on Google (This bit of text will never be visible to visitors of your website, it is exclusively used by search engines.): ![Image of meta description from the footer section within Essentials, on Google](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/5_Pages/images/essentials_footer_meta_description.png)


- **Company Details:** In the UK, these are the typical three pieces of information, included on most companies' websites. E.g. the company name, which countries the company was incorporated in and what the company number is. If either of these fields does not contain any text, the CMS will remove that line and close the space it left automatically. The final result online looks like this: ![Image of the company details section, within the footer section within Essentials, but on the pink pigeon website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/5_Pages/images/essentials_footer_company_details_on_pp_website.png)


- **Download Links 1-3:** Here, using the up-arrow icon (![Image of the up-arrow for file uploads](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/common_elements_images/up_arrow_icon.png)) you may upload a .PDF (recommended) or .TXT file (you can upload other file types) up to 2MB big. For larger files you will have to contact us. The files will be shown using the description you enter into the left field. See here how "Special Thanks", "Privacy Policy" and "Cookie Policy" are displayed on our own website: ![Image of the download links section, within the footer section within Essentials, but on the pink pigeon website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/5_Pages/images/essentials_footer_download_links_on_pp_website.png)

## (Advanced Users) Footer

Advanced users get some additional options to edit within the footer section:

- Font colour, which controls the colour of the text within the footer:

- Rollover colour (for elements like links):
