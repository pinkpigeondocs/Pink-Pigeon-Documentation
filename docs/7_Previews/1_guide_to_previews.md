# Guide to Previews

Previewing your site is done via the preview button:

## Preview Availability

You may always preview your site. 
The preview can be accessed from the ```/pages``` (pages overview) and also the specific page's section, e.g. ```/pages/home```.

The preview lives at https://previews.pinkpigeon.co.uk/your-site's-id. For example:

```tip
If you bookmark the link to your preview, you will always be able to find it there.
```

```warning
Your preview link is a public, yet secure link, meaning it can't be found on search engines and it can't be guessed by anyone. This means you have to be very careful about who gets the preview link, as they will be able to access your preview site forever, from that point on. Please keep the preview link as safe as any other unfinished idea for your business, that you do not want the public to see yet.
```
