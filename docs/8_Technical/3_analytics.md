# Analytics

## Silver Users

From silver and up, users can add a [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) tag to their website.

There is a tutorial showing how you can get your analytics tag [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080).

The only part of the analytics tag that you need is the Tracking ID (mentioned in part 5 of the tutorial above) that looks like this: UA-123456789-1

Once you have added that within the website builder, by clicking here:

And adding your code here:

You should be able to see traffic come through to your site, so long as someone visits your site without an adblocker (or adblocking browser like Firefox or Brave).
