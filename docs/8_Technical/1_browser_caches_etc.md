# Browser Caching / Incognito

We would generally recommend using Firefox, as it makes a lot of these things much easier than other browsers.

## Firefox

- **Opening an Incognito Tab**

You can either hit "ctrl+shift+p" (on Mac, Windows or Linux), or select the following item in your menu:

- **Clearing your cache**

Sometimes, even an incognito window won't be enough. In order to clear your cache, go to "preferences" (like in the image above), Privacy & Security -> Cookies and Site Data -> Clear Data.

Then select 'clear' and refresh your website. You may also have to restart your browser, if your changes are not showing yet.

## Chrome

You can either hit "ctrl+shift+n" (on Mac, Windows or Linux), or select the following item in your menu:
