# Changing Nameservers

When you hit 'publish' for the first time, we will activate your domain with our hosting provider.
To do this, we will need you to change something called the nameservers of your domain. (This happens at your registrar, for example, Godaddy, 123reg, Namecheap, Strato, etc.)

Don't worry, this is only two small bits of text to copy and paste and we will show you how to do this for the biggest domain name registrars.

## Entering your Domain

Here you will need to enter the domain of your website. The format is "example.com", there is no need to add "www." or "http://" / "https://".

Please also do not add any subdomains, like "thing.example.com" or folders, like "example.com/folder".

Once you have entered your domain name, we will set your site to 'pending'.

## Changing your nameservers

Now you have to go to your registrar and change your nameservers within 6 hours.

Note: It's "CustomDNS" that you are after in this guide.

- **GoDaddy:** https://uk.godaddy.com/help/change-nameservers-for-my-domains-664
Note: In step 5, it's "Enter my own nameservers" that you need.

## Pending Site

When your site is 'pending', you will see a notification at the top of the page and the 'publish' button will display 'pending...'

Clicking either the link in the notification or the 'pending...' button will open this popup:

Once you have applied your nameserver change, you can click the 'check' button, which will confirm whether your site has been enabled yet.

It can take up to 24h for this change to appear, but it's likely going to happen within an hour.

## Publish your site

If the check succeeds, you will be able to make your new site live at your domain, by clicking 'publish'.
