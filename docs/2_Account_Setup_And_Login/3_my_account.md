# My Account

Once your account registration is complete, you may access "My Account" via the main menu. The main menu can be found in the top-right corner of the screen and will look like this on desktop:

And like this on mobile:

Once you have opened the menu by clicking on either area highlighted above, you will see the menu item "My Account", as shown below:

Selecting "My Account" will take you to the "My Account" screen:

Here you will find the information you provided us with at the time of registration, along with the option to change your mobile phone number and an option to opt out of email communications (though we discourage this, as we may communicate essential changes via email and we do try to send emails very rarely).

Please remember to select 'update' if you are changing your phone number or the email opt-in / opt-out.

Lastly, you may reset your password on this screen. We will show a confirmation prompt before sending you a confirmation email with a link allowing you to reset your password. The steps are the same as item 1.) in [resetting your password][resetpw].

You do not need to select 'update' in order to change your password. If you change your mind and do not wish to amend your password, but have already asked us to send you a password-reset email, then you can simply ignore the email and your original password will remain valid.
