# Account Types

There are two kinds of account, "Standard" and "Advanced". Standard accounts have access to more basic functionality than advanced accounts.

In the documentation, functionality available for standard / advanced users is pointed out by the heading of each item including either "(Standard users)" or "(Advanced users)".

If you are a standard user and would like to become an advanced one, we can switch your account, for a small increase in the monthly fee.
