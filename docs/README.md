## My Account

Once your account registration is complete, you may access "My Account" via the main menu. The main menu can be found in the top-right corner of the screen and will look like this on desktop:

![Image of main menu location on desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/main_menu_location_desktop.png)

And like this on mobile:

![Image of main menu location on mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/main_menu_location_mobile.png)

Once you have opened the menu by clicking on either area highlighted above, you will see the menu item "My Account", as shown below:

![Image of main menu opened, "My Account" highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/main_menu_my_account.png)

Selecting "My Account" will take you to the "My Account" screen:

Here you will find the information you provided us with at the time of registration, along with the option to change your mobile phone number and an option to opt out of e-mail communications (though we discourage this, as we may communicate essential changes via e-mail and we do try to send e-mails very rarely).

Please remember to select 'update' if you are changing your phone number or the e-mail opt-in / opt-out.

Lastly, you may reset your password on this screen. We will show a confirmation prompt before sending you a confirmation e-mail with a link allowing you to reset your password. The steps are the same as item 1.) in [resetting your password](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#resetting-your-password).

You do not need to select 'update' in order to change your password. If you change your mind and do not wish to amend your password, but have already asked us to send you a password-reset e-mail, then you can simply ignore the e-mail and your original password will remain valid.

# The Home Screen

We will be using our very own site [pinkpigeon.co.uk](https://pinkpigeon.co.uk) for all of our examples. Here is the home screen (which will be the first screen you see after logging in):

## The Pink Pigeon Logo

In the top left corner you can see our Pink Pigeon logo, which will always take you back to this screen, from anywhere within the CMS.

## Your website's name

Immediately below, your website's name (Please note that you cannot change this yourself. If you would like it changed, please [contact us](https://cms.pinkpigeon.co.uk/contact)):

![Image of the home screen, website title highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/home_website_title.png)

## Essentials and Navigation

The next two items are ["Website Essentials"](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#website-essentials) and ["Menu and Navigation"](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#menu-and-navigation). These exist for evey website and have their own sections within the documentation.

## Your website's pages

Then we have the pages of your website. If you look at their titles, you will see how they correspond with the navigation items on our website.
Please note that "Home" is a mandatory page, as every website needs to have a "Home" page, thus it is not normally shown as a navigation item on your website.

![Image of the home screen, page names highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/home_page_names_highlighted.png)

![Image of the pink pigeon website, page names highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/pp_website_nav_example.png)

As you can see, neither their order, nor whether the item is shown at all, matches with what the CMS shows. That is because these items are fully configurable. For a how-to, feel free to go to [the navigation section](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#menu-and-navigation).

## The preview button

The "Preview" button will take you to the preview of your website. There is a dedicated section about previews. This button will remain visible where-ever you scroll within the page.

# Website Essentials

## Favicon

The so-called 'Favicon' is a small logo, which will show up in browser tabs, or on the home-screen of mobile devices (if someone was to add a shortcut to your website on their mobile phone, for example).
Supported formats are .png, .jpeg / .jpg, .gif format. Technically, .ico, .svg and .bmp are supported by some browsers, but can't be guaranteed to work universally.

# Technical Information

## Supported Browsers

We support most desktop and mobile web browsers for viewing and editing your site, but we are unable to guarantee full functionality across every browser and device. Some older browsers are too archaic to support our build methods and are used by such a small percentage of users that we have chosen to focus our support on the most recent versions of most major browsers. If you need your site to work on a browser that we do not fully support, it may be possible but we will have to quote for this work on a case by case basis.

Our fully supported browser list means your site will work for most people, however anyone on an older browser will receive a prompt to update their browser to something that we do support (which is safer and better for them for all online browsing). 

You can use the CMS and your website across the following browsers and devices:

- Chrome - Supported for Windows, Mac and Linux, from version 80 upwards
- Firefox - Supported for Windows, Mac and Linux, from version 72 upwards
- Safari - Supported for Mac only, from version 12 upwards
- Microsoft Edge - Supported for Windows only, from version 80 upwards
- Android Browser - Support for Android devices, from version 76 upwards
- iOS Safari - Supported for iOS devices, from version 13 upwards

We do not support Internet Explorer as Microsoft no longer support it (as it has been superseded by Edge). 

There are a few important things to be aware of when using a supported browser:
- We are unable to support Beta versions of browsers
- Private browsing may not be supported for editing your site
- Some browser add-ons may interfere with your site, so they may need to be disabled while we troubleshoot issues
- JavaScript must be enabled

We are unable to support screen resolutions below 320 pixels wide due to the quantity of content required by our clients. Our sites will display a horizontal scrollbar on sites under this width so you will still be able to interact with the site as normal.
