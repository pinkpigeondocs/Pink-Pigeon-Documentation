# Introduction

Hello! We are Claire & Adrian, and our business is called [Pink Pigeon Digital Limited][pp]. 

When all of this started, we really just wanted to run a [blog][ccc] online. 

We quickly noticed that running a blog was neither cheap, nor intuitive, nor quick & easy to do.

That came as a surprise, as a blog _looks_ like a simple thing to do. It's _just_ a website, right?

After trying Wix, Squarespace, Wordpress, Netlify, Github (Pages), Heroku, etc. we realised that, while all of these businesses offer a great service, it just wasn't what we were after. Try as they might, they will tell you how 'quick and easy' it is to do 'anything you want' using their platforms, but ultimately they make you sign up for an account and then you are on your own. 

And for almost everyone, that's just fine.

We, however, wanted something different. There is a small, but not insignificant portion of website owners who would like something more personal. Something more human, more precise and more refined.

We made our own website platform, according to our needs and we hope that our approach stands out from 'quick and easy', making it 'just right' instead.
