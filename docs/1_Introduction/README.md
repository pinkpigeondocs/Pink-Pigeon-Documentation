Hello! We are Claire & Adrian, and our business is called [Pink Pigeon Digital Ltd][pp].....

When all of this started, we really just wanted to run a [blog][ccc] online.

We quickly noticed that running a blog was neither cheap, nor intuitive, nor quick & easy to do.

That came as a surprise, as a blog _looks_ like a simple thing to do. It's _just_ a website, right?

After trying Wix, Squarespace, Wordpress, Netlify, Github (Pages), Heroku, etc. we realised that, while all of these businesses offer a great service, it just wasn't what we were after. Try as they might, they will tell you how 'quick and easy' it is to do 'anything you want' using their platforms, but ultimately they make you sign up for an account and then you are on your own, without human customer support.

We wanted a way to update our websites quickly, on the go, **via our mobile phones, without losing functionality**. We wanted our sites to load quickly, without delays. No wasted data, no wasted time waiting for unoptimised code to load.

We wanted direct, immediate feedback for any changes we made to our websites. Fast iteration, playful interaction with content, to be able to try a few different things and see how it works, right there and then, like so:

And we wanted all of that to be secure, accessible and affordable. Turns out that that did not exist. Not the way we wanted to do it. So we made our own website platform, according to our needs and we hope that our approach stands out from 'quick and easy', making it 'just right' instead.

If that sounds good to you, then let us tell you all about it on the following pages, starting right at the beginning:
