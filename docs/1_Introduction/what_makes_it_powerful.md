# What makes your CMS stand out?

## In short

- [Realtime, multi-device previews](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/7_Previews/1_guide_to_previews.html#realtime-previews)
- Safety (as per Mozilla Observatory)
- Speed (our sites are leaner, faster, more optimised than what any other website builder can achieve)
- Mobile optimised ease of use (Squarespace, Wix, Wordpress and the likes will tell you they about mobile optimisations, but they are just not as usable as our CMS)

## How are you different from Wordpress, etc.?

It depends on the problem you are trying to solve and what your ultimate goal is. The large incumbents, such as Wordpress and Squarespace have thousands of developers working around the clock to add features to their platforms. They spend millions on marketing efforts. In order to do so, they need to earn even more millions. That means they end up with platforms that are trying to be too much at the same time, in an effort to appeal to as broad an audience as possible.

We are a small team, solving a very specific problem for our specific customers. We don't try to be everything to everyone. That gives us a major advantage in terms of developing a clean codebase, with optimisations that are impossible at the scale of Wordpress etc.

## Problem Solving

The problem the big companies are solving is: "How do we make more money?". And that can only be achieved at the staggering "millions of users"-scales that these companies run on. This means there is no real support, unless you pay a fortune to be assigned a 'Support Agent', who is still dealing with hundreds, if not thousands of separate cases, and who will hand you off to someone else at the drop of a hat. This also means that their documentation will be complicated and all over the place. There is a reason why so many people have made it their only job to build Wordpress or Squarespace sites: It's still an entire, full-time job building and running these sites.

Wordpress, Squarespace, etc. have 'open signups', which means anyone can register an account and start working right away, whether they know what they are doing or not.

## Hidden Costs

There are just so many hidden costs tucked away under layers and layers of confusing language. Wordpress, Wix, etc. sound cheap upfront, to get your business, but that offerring will be extremely limited and you will only find out later that a huge variety of additional features add to your monthly cost, where even simple sites quickly exceed the costs you'll ever face with our system.

## Our Goals

The problems we are solving are the very problems brought about by solutions that were designed by these large corporations. As I mentioned in the introduction, we were constantly running into nonsensical barriers, trying to simply publish a blog of ours quickly, cheaply and easily. There was no mobile support, no support for Content Security Policies, little control over the theming or custom functionalities, far too much Javascript and unnecessary CSS, unclear class names, unclear site structures, etc. etc.

So we went and built something that they cannot build. A smaller, faster, more efficient system designed for the kinds of customers we personally select, based on whether our system is suitable for them, which won't make us millionaires, but which provides a solid service at a bearable cost.
