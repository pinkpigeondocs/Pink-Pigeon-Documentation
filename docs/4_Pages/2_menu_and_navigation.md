# Menu and Navigation

Here you can add, remove or change the items shown in the main navigation (or menu) of your website. You will also be able to decide what the menu itself looks like.

## (Standard users) Logo

This is the logo of your website. Typically situated in the top-left corner. Here you may upload images in .GIF, .SVG or .PNG format, with or without transparency (.JPG works as well, but this format does not support transparency at all). We recommend using .SVG, as this is a screen-resolution independent format which always looks good (say, on retina-style iPads, as well as 4k monitors or really low-resolution mobile phones.)

Image upload size is limited to 2MB, and images above 512kb will be compressed by our system, to ensure your website stays fast for all users.

## (Standard users) Menu Items

Standard users may change the name of their menu items, as well as their order. All other options are disabled.

As you can see by the red outline around "Other Services", we have decided to exceed the character-limit in this one instance, as it did not negatively affect the design of the navigation items on our site. Generally we would discourage this, as we have set these limits to ensure that all menu items fit. (For example, if your menu items contained a lot of wide letters, like 'w', especially in upper-case, the design, or layout of the nav will reach its limits much sooner. That is the limit we have defined using our green character count indicators.)

## (Advanced users) Menu Items

Advanced users may add / remove or re-order their navigation items. They can also determine which sections to link to and rename each navigation item.

- Changing what a nav item links to:

The left field, when selected, will display a list of all Pages and Modules within your website. You may link to any of them from the navigation of your website.


## (Standard users) Desktop Style

The reason this item is called 'Desktop' Style, is that this option only affects how the menu is shown on larger browser window sizes (desktop computers, with the browser in full-screen for example).
