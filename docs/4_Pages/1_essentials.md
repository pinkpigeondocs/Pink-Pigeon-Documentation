# Website Essentials

The website essentials are a collection of settings that affect the most basic parts of your website. Depending on the type of access you have, you can change many of the fundamental visual attributes of your website here.

## (Standard users) Favicon

The so-called 'Favicon' is a small logo, which will show up in browser tabs, or on the home-screen of mobile devices (if someone was to add a shortcut to your website on their mobile phone, for example).
Supported formats are .png, .jpeg / .jpg, .gif format. Technically, .ico, .svg and .bmp are supported by some browsers, but can't be guaranteed to work universally.

## (Standard users) Footer

The footer section looks as follows:

The footer section allows you to edit:

- Meta Description: This is a (short) bit of copy, which is used by Google and other search engines to show what your page is about in the search results. For our own website, it looks like this on Google: ![Image of meta description from the footer section within Essentials, on Google](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/4_Pages/essentials_footer_meta_description.png)
This bit of text will never be visible to visitors of your website, it is exclusively used by search engines.

- Company Details: In the UK, these are the typical three pieces of information, included on most companies' websites. E.g. the company name, which countries the company was incorporated in and what the company number is. The final result online looks like this: ![Image of the company details section, within the footer section within Essentials, but on the pink pigeon website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/4_Pages/essentials_footer_company_details_on_pp_website.png)
If either of these fields does not contain any text, the CMS will remove that line and close the space it left automatically.

- Download Links 1-3: Here you may upload a .PDF (recommended) or .TXT file (you can upload other file types) up to 2MB big. For larger files you will have to contact us. The files will be shown using the description you enter into the left field. See here how "Special Thanks", "Privacy Policy" and "Cookie Policy" are displayed on our own website: ![Image of the download links section, within the footer section within Essentials, but on the pink pigeon website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/4_Pages/essentials_footer_download_links_on_pp_website.png)
