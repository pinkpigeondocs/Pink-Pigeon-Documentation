# Website Essentials

The website essentials are a collection of settings that affect the most basic parts of your website. Depending on the type of access you have, you can change many of the fundamental visual attributes of your website here.

## (Standard users) Favicon

The so-called 'Favicon' is a small logo, which will show up in browser tabs, or on the home-screen of mobile devices (if someone was to add a shortcut to your website on their mobile phone, for example).
Supported formats are .png, .jpeg / .jpg, .gif format. Technically, .ico, .svg and .bmp are supported by some browsers, but can't be guaranteed to work universally.
