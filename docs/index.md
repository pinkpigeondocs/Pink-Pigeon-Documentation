# Introduction to the Pink Pigeon CMS

CMS stands for Content Management System. This is the term commonly used for any type of software or application (most commonly used via the internet) which allows you to manage your website.
Honestly, if it wasn't such an established term, we would call it the Pink Pigeon Website Management Platform, as that more accurately describes what we are providing to our customers.
The following documentation aims to describe every bit of functionality we offer. Consider it the place where you would go if the FAQ section has not answered your question.

# Account Setup & Login

## Registration and login

Once we have setup an account for you in our system, we will send you an e-mail from support@mail.pinkpigeon.co.uk (please make sure that the message came from this address and no other) which looks like this:

![Image of the registration e-mail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/registration_email.png)

Where it says "citycitycountry", you will see your own account name, which we will have setup for you prior to sending out this e-mail.
When you click the link in the e-mail, you will be taken to the registration page at "https://cms.pinkpigeon.co.uk/register", which looks like this:

![Image of the registration screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/registration_screen.png)

This screen should show the e-mail address which you have provided to us. (For this example, we are using one of our online projects, citycitycountry@gmail.com).
We normally recommend to make passwords into a short, easy to remember sentence, which contains upper and lower-case letters, as well as a number and a special symbol. Here is an example: "MyHouse!sY3llow". We have setup our system so that we will NEVER be able to see your password. Should you ever forget, you may reset the password at any time. If you need to find out right away, please go [here](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#resetting-your-password).

Before you can register, you will need to read and accept our privacy and cookie policies. Please do read these documents carefully, as you are bound by their rules once you agree by checking the corresponding box. 
You are also able to opt in or out of future e-mail communications. It is highly recommended that you opt in, as we will never spam you. You will only receive the most essential communications, which will be infrequent.

Once you have registered, the system will automatically log you in and you can get started using the CMS right away!

If, however, you decide to log out, or want to use the CMS on another computer, you will be using...

## The login screen

If you are not already logged into the system, the first thing you will see at https://cms.pinkpigeon.co.uk/ will be the login screen:

![Image of the login screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/login_screen.png)

Once you have completed registration (as described above), you may use the e-mail address for your account and the password you chose, to login. Once logged in, your login is valid indefinitely (and therefore it is important to not forget to logout when using public computers, or any device that is not your own personal device) and in one place only. Thus, should you login on your desktop computer and shortly after on your mobile phone, the desktop will be logged out once you come back to the CMS on there. 

Should you have forgotten your password, you may reset it by selecting ["Forgot your password?"](https://cms.pinkpigeon.co.uk/forgot).

## Resetting your password

There are two ways to reset your password. 

1.) From the login screen, which will take you to this screen:

![Image of password reset from login screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/reset_pw_from_login.png)

Once you have entered your e-mail address, and the system recognises your account, we will send you a confirmation e-mail, which will come from support@mail.pinkpigeon.co.uk (please make sure that the message came from this address and no other) and look like this:

![Image of password reset password e-mail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/reset_pw_email.png)

2.) From within your "My Account" area, which is shown as part of the "My Account" section below.

## My Account

Once your account registration is complete, you may access "My Account" via the main menu. The main menu can be found in the top-right corner of the screen and will look like this on desktop:

![Image of main menu location on desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/main_menu_location_desktop.png)

And like this on mobile:

![Image of main menu location on mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/main_menu_location_mobile.png)

Once you have opened the menu by clicking on either area highlighted above, you will see the menu item "My Account", as shown below:

![Image of main menu opened, "My Account" highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/main_menu_my_account.png)

Selecting "My Account" will take you to the "My Account" screen:

![Image of "My Account" opened](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/my_account_main.png)

Here you will find the information you provided us with at the time of registration, along with the option to change your mobile phone number and an option to opt out of e-mail communications (though we discourage this, as we may communicate essential changes via e-mail and we do try to send e-mails very rarely).

Please remember to select 'update' if you are changing your phone number or the e-mail opt-in / opt-out.

Lastly, you may reset your password on this screen. We will show a confirmation prompt before sending you a confirmation e-mail with a link allowing you to reset your password. The steps are the same as item 1.) in [resetting your password](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#resetting-your-password).

You do not need to select 'update' in order to change your password. If you change your mind and do not wish to amend your password, but have already asked us to send you a password-reset e-mail, then you can simply ignore the e-mail and your original password will remain valid.

# The Home Screen

We will be using our very own site [pinkpigeon.co.uk](https://pinkpigeon.co.uk) for all of our examples. Here is the home screen (which will be the first screen you see after logging in):

![Image of the home screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/home_main.png)

- In the top left corner you can see our Pink Pigeon logo, which will always take you back to this screen, from anywhere within the CMS. 

![Image of the home screen, Pink Pigeon highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/home_pink_pigeon_logo.png)

- Immediately below, your website's name (Please note that you cannot change this yourself. If you would like it changed, please [contact us](https://cms.pinkpigeon.co.uk/contact)):

![Image of the home screen, website title highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/home_website_title.png)

- The next two items are ["Website Essentials"](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#website-essentials) and ["Menu and Navigation"](https://pinkpigeondocs.github.io/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/#menu-and-navigation). These exist for evey website and have their own sections within the documentation.

![Image of the home screen, essentials and navigation highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinkpigeondocs/Pink-Pigeon-Documentation/master/docs/home_essentials_navigation.png)

- Lastly we have the pages of your website. If you look at their titles, you will see how they correspond with the navigation items on our website. Please see the two images below:

# Technical Information

## Supported Browsers

We support most desktop and mobile web browsers for viewing and editing your site, but we are unable to guarantee full functionality across every browser and device. Some older browsers are too archaic to support our build methods and are used by such a small percentage of users that we have chosen to focus our support on the most recent versions of most major browsers. If you need your site to work on a browser that we do not fully support, it may be possible but we will have to quote for this work on a case by case basis.

Our fully supported browser list means your site will work for most people, however anyone on an older browser will receive a prompt to update their browser to something that we do support (which is safer and better for them for all online browsing). 

You can use the CMS and your website across the following browsers and devices:

- Chrome - Supported for Windows, Mac and Linux, from version 80 upwards
- Firefox - Supported for Windows, Mac and Linux, from version 72 upwards
- Safari - Supported for Mac only, from version 12 upwards
- Microsoft Edge - Supported for Windows only, from version 80 upwards
- Android Browser - Support for Android devices, from version 76 upwards
- iOS Safari - Supported for iOS devices, from version 13 upwards

We do not support Internet Explorer as Microsoft no longer support it (as it has been superseded by Edge). 

There are a few important things to be aware of when using a supported browser:
- We are unable to support Beta versions of browsers
- Private browsing may not be supported for editing your site
- Some browser add-ons may interfere with your site, so they may need to be disabled while we troubleshoot issues
- JavaScript must be enabled

We are unable to support screen resolutions below 320 pixels wide due to the quantity of content required by our clients. Our sites will display a horizontal scrollbar on sites under this width so you will still be able to interact with the site as normal.
